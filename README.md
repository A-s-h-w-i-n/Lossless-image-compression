# Lossless-image-compression
Lossless image compresion and recovery using Huffman Encoding 

This project uses Huffman encoding technique to compress Bitmap images without any loss of information.

To compress images, run the script huffman.m and choose the image that needs to be compressed. The output
produces a compressed image file and a DAT file containing the huffman dictionary.

To recover the original image, run the sript huffman_decom.m and select the corresponding compressed image
and DAT file.
